                                The Certified Facility Manager® (CFM) credential sets the industry standard for ensuring 
                                the knowledge and competence of practicing facility managers.

                                IFMA’s certification process is designed to assess competency in the field through work 
                                experience, education and the ability to pass a comprehensive exam that covers 11 competencies 
                                that make up the facility management body of knowledge. Since the program began in 1992, more 
                                than 3,100 facility managers from 32 countries have achieved this prestigious recognition.

                    <p><i><blockquote>
                        "You have a great job. Your employer is rock solid. Your last performance rating was 
                        excellent and the future looks bright. One day, you go to work and your job no longer exists.
                        It happens easier and faster than you can imagine.

                        When you enter a tight job market, what will distinguish you from the crowd? Employers look 
                        for leaders and demonstrated skill in an area of practice. Your CFM shows you have the interest 
                        and skill in facility management to be the best. It shows you have the tenacity to keep those
                        skills sharp year after year.
                            
                        What better example of leadership than to choose to be the best and advertise it.
                        When I entered the job market after years with the same job, I was very concerned about my marketability. 
                        How could I be sure my skills would translate to a new place and were they even still valid in the current 
                        market? By becoming a CFM and maintaining the designation, I was forced to update my skills yearly to keep 
                        the designation. Without realizing it, I was preparing for the day when a job change became essential.
                            
                        Where would I be now if I had been forced to find a new job and had not stayed current in my profession? 
                        How could I answer a prospective employer’s questions about my education in facility management? What could
                        I offer to separate me from the pack? A CFM is more important than you think!"
