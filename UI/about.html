                        <h2>THE BEGINNING</h2>
                    </div>
                        <p class="mb-30">In 1995, some practitioners came together  in Lagos  with the vision of having 
                            a professional body that would breed a new generation of facility managers, this led to the 
                            birth of IFMA Nigeria Chapter. Since inception, the desire of the Association to provide
                            Nigeria with the opportunity of developing a vibrant maintenance culture which will help
                            shape the future of the country.
                            <br><br>
                            Subscribing to Mobil’s cliché that it ‘’takes courageous leadership to admit that we must improve
                            our quality’’ these multi-disciplined professionals in Mobil, Chevron and others propose setting
                            up our quality improvement goals aimed at bringing the international standards of facility 
                            management to bear on maintenance of infrastructure in Nigeria.
