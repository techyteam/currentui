                                                    <p>LAGOS – Efforts to bring to the front burner the place and the impacts of facility management in boosting investment and the nation’s economy became loud in Lagos last week, as experts in field, under the aegis of International Facility Management Association (IFMA), Nigeria chapter, gathered to examine the issues bedeviling the sector as well as mapping out the future.
                                                        From the professionals, particularly IFMA members on one hand, and stakeholders both in public and private service, the consensus was that, there a need to make facility management of buildings and infrastructures a central focus.
                                                    
                                                        It was at the IFMA’s maiden Advocacy Day in Lagos and the resource persons spoke on a theme: ‘Facility management – Panacea For A Sustainable Nation Building’. Facility management, popularly referred to as FM is a profession that encompasses multiple disciplines to ensure functionality, comfort, safety and efficiency of the built environment by integrating people, place, process and technology. The International Organization for Standardization defines FM as the “organizational function, which integrates people, place and process within the built environment with the purpose of improving the quality of life of people and the productivity of the core business.</p>

                                                        <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
                                                            <p>In real estate, property management is simply building or property maintenance while Facility Management covers the basic needs or facilities delivered to the occupant or tenant to provide him the maximum living comforts as per predefined standards, though both of them needs management of human resources, financial and material resources. But, while facility management is already popular in the developed world, it’s acceptability and, or ranking in Nigeria is still wobbling.

                                                                This may be the reason why if you ask Nigerians the meaning of maintenance, it is plausible to expect majority jump into answering the question without a clear understanding.</p>
                                                        </div>
                                                        <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">

                                                                Whilst many may claim to understand, they rarely practice what they know. This explains why Nigerians spend millions in building or buying an edifice but consider a few hundreds of thousand on maintenance as waste of hard earned money. This fact is pronounced, particularly with many public buildings or infrastructures. However, you there a few private buildings that are left to wane in value due to lack of qualified facility managers in place.

                                                                An arbitrary statistics will show that more than half of the Nigerian population does not really understand the importance of facility management. Our lack of understanding in this regard is reflective of our poor maintenance culture, collectively as a nation and individually.</p>

                                                    <p>Dilapidated national structures that should have been national monuments are replete everywhere. Our federal secretariat in Ikoyi is a worthy national embarrassment that must not be shown to our kids. The National Theatre in Iganmu that should have been a tourist attraction is best described as the “shame of a nation”. But, thanks to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for its recent initiative to revamp the National Theatre. What about the Cocoa House in Ibadan, Oyo state?

                                                        We spend billions on building stadia across the country and all of them have become comfy habitats for reptiles and other species of the animal kingdom. We only remember to renovate when the Super Eagles have a friendly match against the Black Stars of Ghana or another footballing nation.
                                                        
                                                        Ours is a country that can spend billions on erecting a structure but fails to pay millions for the management and maintenance of the building. We are a nation where people would rather wait for the bulbs in their rooms to go off before they are replace; yet, the same bulbs have expiry date written on them. Who even bothers to check the expiry date on goods in Nigeria except for consumables? That is our reality as a nation.
                                                        
                                                        This bad culture is visible in virtually all sectors of the economy. It is why our airports have remained the way they are. It is why we have decrepit vehicles moving human lives from one location to the other.
                                                        
                                                        And this is ultimately responsible for the struggle of the facility management industry in Nigeria. Whenever facility management is mentioned in Nigeria, many erroneously think about cleaning services, which is actually the most basic aspect of the business.
                                                        
                                                        Yet, it is a big industry in developed world contributing hugely to the overall economy. For instance, the European facility management market alone was estimated to worth €640 billion and ranging from 5-8 per cent of GDP in individual countries, while the global market was estimated to grow to $US1.3 trillion in 2018.
                                                        
                                                        Apart from major companies that have departments responsible for managing their facilities, not many Nigerians see this as an important element of building and general living.
                                                        
                                                        But, determined to change the narrative, IFMA rallied round several experts and stakeholders, who used the opportunity to seek for a rethink on facility management.
                                                        
                                                        Hence, there was a collective decision to rev up facility management.
                                                        
                                                        While some of the stakeholders called for inclusion of facility managers at the project conception stage, others urged IFMA members to ensure there is legislation for facility management in Nigeria.
                                                        
                                                        According to them, without professionally handling facility management in Nigeria, the nation’s assets and pride would continue to be derelict, hence, tasked both Federal and state governments to imbibe culture of maintaining infrastructure in the country.
                                                        
                                                        To do this, they argued, there must deliberate on the part of all stakeholders, as it had become necessary for facility managers and other stakeholders in the public and private sectors to come together and help to reduce infrastructure decay due to lack of maintenance.
                                                        
                                                        In his speech, Mr. Segun Adebayo, IFMA’s Nigeria acting president, said the management and maintenance of infrastructure remained a sustainable way of nation building.
                                                        
                                                        According to Adebayo, IFMA Nigeria planned to collaborate with private and public sectors to improve the maintenance culture in the built environment and change the narrative about facility management in the country.
                                                        
                                                        He said despite the wrong perception by many, his association was determined to help both government and private entitles to enjoy their facilities, urging them to engage professional and certified facility managers.
                                                        
                                                        Arc. Har Yusuph, the Managing Director, Lagos State Development and Property Corporation, who noted that facility management was of great importance to the nation, called for its encouragement at all levels.
                                                        
                                                        According to Yusuph, there was need to have a regulatory framework for facility management in the country.
                                                        
                                                        He said IFMA may need to go further to ensure regulation and enforcement of maintenance culture across the nation.
                                                        
                                                        He urged IFMA to carry out training and enforcement in all states and local government areas as well as ensure maintenance of facilities using qualified professionals and personnel.
                                                        
                                                        Yusuph said the group should also collaborate with other professional bodies such as the Nigerian Institute of Architects, the Nigerian Society of Engineers and others and form a forum for registration, training and enlightenment.
                                                        
                                                        “The LSDPC has a lot of estates spread across the state and they are in dire need of facility managers to maintain buildings,” he said.
                                                        
                                                        Adenike Adekambi, General Manager, Lagos State Infrastructure Management Agency (LASIAMA), revealed that the Lagos state government was working towards institutionalizing facility management across the state, urging unflinching support to IFMA.
                                                        
                                                        According her, the state government has in place a policy that ensures that all facility management companies are registered with IFMA.
                                                        
                                                        She said the Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s administration had decided to ensure that all its facilities are maintained.
                                                        
                                                        She urged experts to present facility management from an economic point of view; saying once the proposals were properly presented to the clients would see their investment as a gain rather than a burden.
                                                        
                                                        Dr. Iqmat Koleosho, Deputy Dean, Faculty of Facility and Environmental Management, University of Lagos, said it would be a good idea to have facility managers at the conception stage of a building and within the building team as consultants.
                                                        
                                                        “If that is not achieved, we will continue to have problems with the maintenance of our facilities,” she said.
                                                        
                                                        Koleosho said 90 per cent of maintenance and facility management issues could be resolved at the design stage.
